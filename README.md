### Definition of SOLID

```
SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob).
```

## S (Single-responsibility Principle)

Single-responsibility Principle (SRP) states:

```
A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
```

## O (Open-Closed Principle)

Open-closed Principle (OCP) states:

```
Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
```

## O (Liskov Substitution Principle)

Liskov Substitution Principle states:

```
Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.
```
